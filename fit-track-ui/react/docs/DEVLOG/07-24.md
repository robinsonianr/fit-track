# Development Log - Fit Track

## 2024-06-21 - Theme System Implementation

### What I Worked On


- Migrated from inline Tailwind classes to component-based CSS architecture
- Implemented dark/light theme toggle functionality
- Fixed ESLint errors and Stylelint configuration


### Key Decisions Made


- Chose `@layer components` approach for CSS organization
- Simplified Header props to accept `name` string instead of full customer object
- Used Tailwind's modern opacity syntax (`bg-black/50` instead of `bg-opacity-50`)


### Challenges Faced


- ESLint errors with unused variables
- Stylelint deprecation warnings for `@apply`
- Theme toggle not working initially due to context setup


### Solutions Found


- Commented out unused variables temporarily
- Added `"at-rule-no-deprecated": null` to Stylelint config
- Fixed theme context implementation


### Files Modified


- `src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/layout.tsx`
- `.stylelintrc.json`


### Commits Made


- `refactor: migrate to component-based CSS architecture`
- `refactor: simplify Header props to accept customer name as string`
- `chore(stylelint): disable at-rule-no-deprecated to allow Tailwind @apply usage`


### Next Steps


- [ ] Test theme toggle on all screen sizes
- [ ] Review PR with collaborator
- [ ] Plan next feature implementation
